#Final Analysis

From the scatter plot Pyber Ride Sharing Data, you can see that there is high number of Uber rides particulary in Urban
cities vs. Rural. In highly dense cities, you can pretty much assume that people use a lot more Uber than in rural areas. 
Furthermore, if you looking to be a driver, you should drive in urban areas for the highest return on investment. 
You can still drive in rural and suburban area if need be because although you have less of a chance to get a ride, the 
average ride is higher than in urban areas.
